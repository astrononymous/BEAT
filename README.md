Heart curve inspired javascript canvas art

Inspired by https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/134-heart-curve and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6K-wJQ77yQ (noise gif loops).

Thanks to Daniel Shiffman for making such inspirational content.

This sketch was written in javascript.  There are three .js files attached containing the art: 

  1: BEAT_unedited.js: an unedited version that i considered finished and left alone the moment that i had generated the gif frames that i needed.
  2: BEAT_clean.js: an edited version removing all comments, just containing the functional portion of the code  
  3: BEAT_commented.js: a commented version which explains a little bit about each section of the code.

I ran this project through a node.js express server because some of my sketches require modules that can't be loaded through localhost.  This project doesn't contain any such modules, but i haven't been able to get it to run locally with a quick try so i'm just leaving the server code here too.

There are also one HTML and one CSS file each.
